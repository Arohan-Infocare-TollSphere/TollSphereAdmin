## Repository Structure

This project is organized into three team-specific repositories:

### 1. Platform Team (	ollsphere-platform)
- **Shared Components**: Shared Kernel, Database Infrastructure, Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Protos
- **Services**: Admin API, Web UI
- **Orchestration**: Aspire AppHost and ServiceDefaults
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-service integration tests
- **Multi-Database Support**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

### 2. Core Services Team (	ollsphere-core-services)
- **Services**: LaneOps API (Transaction processing), Payment API (Financial services)
- **Focus**: Core business logic and transaction flow
- **Tests**: Unit tests and team-bound integration tests
- **Edge Device Support**: SQLite for LaneOps edge devices

### 3. Data & Reporting Team (	ollsphere-data-reporting)  
- **Services**: Reporting API (Business intelligence, MIS reports)
- **Focus**: Data aggregation, reporting, and analytics
- **Tests**: Unit tests and team-bound integration tests

## Development Setup

### Full Development (All Teams)
1. Clone all three repositories
2. Use the canonical solution: Arohan.TollSphere.sln
3. Run dotnet restore and dotnet build from root
4. Use Platform team's Aspire project for local orchestration

### Team-Specific Development
1. Clone only your team's repository
2. Use team-specific solution (e.g., 	ollsphere-core-services.sln)
3. Develop and test within team boundaries
4. Coordinate shared changes with Platform team
